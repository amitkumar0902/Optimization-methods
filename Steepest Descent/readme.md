Method to give input
Consider the variables of the given function as elements of x. Give x[0] in place of x1, x[1] in place of x2, etc
eg: (x1-4)^4 + (x2-3)^2 + 4(x3+5)^4 can be given as (x[0] - 4)* 4 + ((x[1]-3)** 2) +(4(x[2] +5)** 4)

Give the intial input in 'x.append' statement
eg: x.append([4,2,-1])

Give Tolerance level in eps
eg: eps = 0.05
